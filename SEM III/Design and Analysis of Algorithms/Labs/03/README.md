# Sorting Algorithms Comparison
I've calculated and plotted the time differences for Bubble sort, Selection sort 
and Merge sort in this program.

### Note
As you can see in the graph, the plot for Selection sort is always below that of 
Bubble sort even though both of them have the same O(n^2) Complexity.  
This is because Bubble sort swaps almost n\*(n-1) elements, while 
Selection sort does only 'n' swaps for an array.
