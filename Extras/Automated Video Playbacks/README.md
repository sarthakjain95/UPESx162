# Automated Video Playbacks  
  
We have this thing in our college where you have to go online to the college
"Blackboard" website ( Which is basically used as an extended platform for 
the course content. It takes some tests. Has course Related videos, other 
content )  
  
But, the problem is that they expect us to go online and watch these videos.  
To ensure that we do watch these videos, they consider a student's online 
activity on this website. Which is really boaring. The content that they have
is not that interesting. It's more of a repetition of what is already taught
in the class. And *I already know. So I made a python script to automate the
entire "Video-Watching" process. This script, when active, basically fires up
a Firefox session in the background and logs in to the UPES BlackBoard and 
lets the user select a course. And then plays all of the videos realted to the
course that we are supposed to watch.  
  
With that said, I would like to mention that there has only been limited testing
for this script. Since I wrote the script just a week before my Mid-Sem Exams.
It does work, on my system.

P.S. : I'll be adding the usage and other details in a few days. This program is
still under development. And I'm continuously testing and fixing bugs for this
program.
