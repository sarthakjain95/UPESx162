**Transducers**  
Transducers are the devices that can convert one form of energy to other form. Thus, Non-electrical physical quantities can be converted to electrical signals.
  
Classification  
1. Thermal  
2. Optical

One of the most important thing in today's world, that plays a major role in the computer industry is semiconductor materials. These are materials having conductivity higher than our usual insulators but quite low when compared with other conductor materials. These are really important because of certain properties that they exhibit. Some of them are given below:  
1. The Moderate Resistance  
2. These have a **negative temperature coefficient of resistance**. Meaning that the resistance of these materials decreases as we increase the temperature.  
3. Doping can easily change the resistance of these materials.  

> **BONDING IN SEMICONDUCTORS**  
> Basically, every atom likes to be stable (by having 8 electrons in their outer shell). But you don't always get what you want in life. So most of them don't really fill in this criteria. And they start sharing the electrons. So everyone's happy. But you see, there's a problem. We really don't have a name for these connection thingies because of an unfortunate accident with an evil witch. Kidding! They are conveniently called **CO-VALENT BONDS**. 
  
> All semiconductor come in these magical cute symmetrical structures that we call crystals. And therefore, if you accidentally break one little piece of germanium from your super high tech semiconductor laser, then you refer to that broken piece as a "crystal".
  
> Let's face it, The world is quite random. We have loads of semiconductors, but the special ones that we will use have a specific property. They glow in the dark. No. (I know they are getting bad with time). WE need a low amount of energy to break the covalent bonds (To release electrons).  
> Most commonly used semiconductors are :
> **GERMANIUM** [ 32(2, 8, 18, 4) ]
> **SILICON**  [ 14(2, 8, 4) ]
  
Going towards a more scientific definition, we have this one :  
Semiconductors are substances that have a completely filled valence band and a nearly empty conduction band.

**EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE**  
  
1. At Abosolute Zero: All the electrons are tightly held. The inner shell electrons are busy looking at the very positive beauty that is the core. While the valence electrons are held tightly in the co-valent bond-making. Making the material act as a perfect insulator (a closed room?). It is due to the unavailability of any bachelor electrons that the material behaves as a perfect insulator.
  
2. Above Abosolute Zero: When the temperature is raised some of the valence electrons break themselves apart from the covalent bonds and start roaming freely throughout the material. If we apply a little bit of potential across the material, we can observe a teeny-tiny current through the material. And this is where we got the idea for a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.
  
**HOLE CURRENT**  
(Unless you live at absolute zero.) At room temperature, the valence electrons in our germanium crystal are pretty much roaming around here and there under the influence of electric fields. Producing current. Killing random superheroes in an epic accident. (I'm looking at you Vanisher!). But as electrons leave their respective place, they produce HOLES in the space that they leave (And apparently some weirdo decided that that only studying the motion of electrons was not enough). So now we have a negative charge and a positive charge( hole ) roaming around in the material. Thermal energy basically produces a pair of Positive-Negative charges.
