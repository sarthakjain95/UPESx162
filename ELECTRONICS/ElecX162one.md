**Transducers**  
Transducers are the devices that can convert one form of energy to other form. Thus, Non-electrical physical quantities can be converted to electrical signals.
  
Classification  
1. Thermal  
2. Optical  
3. Mechanical  
4. Acoustical  
5. Chemical  
6. Magnetic  
  
One of the most important thing in today's world, that plays a major role in the computer industry is semiconductor materials. These are materials having conductivity higher than our usual insulators but quite low when compared with other conductor materials. These are really important because of certain properties that they exhibit. Some of them are given below:  
1. The Moderate Resistance  
2. These have a **negative temperature coefficient of resistance**. Meaning that the resistance of these materials decreases as we increase the temperature.  
3. Doping can easily change the resistance of these materials.  

> **BONDING IN SEMICONDUCTORS**  
> Basically, every atom likes to be stable (by having 8 electrons in their outer shell). But you don't always get what you want in life. So most of them don't really fill in this criteria. And they start sharing the electrons. So everyone's happy. But you see, there's a problem. We really don't have a name for these connection thingies because of an unfortunate accident with an evil witch. Kidding! They are conveniently called **CO-VALENT BONDS**. 
  
> All semiconductor come in these magical cute symmetrical structures that we call crystals. And therefore, if you accidentally break one little piece of germanium from your super high tech semiconductor laser, then you refer to that broken piece as a "crystal".
  
> Let's face it, The world is quite random. We have loads of semiconductors, but the special ones that we will use have a specific property. They glow in the dark. No. (I know they are getting bad with time). WE need a low amount of energy to break the covalent bonds (To release electrons).  
> Most commonly used semiconductors are :
> **GERMANIUM** [ 32(2, 8, 18, 4) ]
> **SILICON**  [ 14(2, 8, 4) ]
  
Going towards a more scientific definition, we have this one :  
Semiconductors are substances that have a completely filled valence band and a nearly empty conduction band.  
See [BAND THEORY](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/band.html)  
  
**EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE**  
  
1. At Abosolute Zero: All the electrons are tightly held. The inner shell electrons are busy looking at the very positive beauty that is the core. While the valence electrons are held tightly in the co-valent bond-making. Making the material act as a perfect insulator (a closed room?). It is due to the unavailability of any bachelor electrons that the material behaves as a perfect insulator.
  
2. Above Abosolute Zero: When the temperature is raised some of the valence electrons break themselves apart from the covalent bonds and start roaming freely throughout the material. If we apply a little bit of potential across the material, we can observe a teeny-tiny current through the material. And this is where we got the idea for a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.
  
**HOLE CURRENT**    
(Unless you live at absolute zero.) At room temperature, the valence electrons in our germanium crystal are pretty much roaming around here and there under the influence of electric fields. Producing current. Killing random superheroes in an epic accident. (I'm looking at you Vanisher!). But as electrons leave their respective place, they produce HOLES in the space that they leave (And apparently some weirdo decided that that only studying the motion of electrons was not enough). So now we have a negative charge and a positive charge( hole ) roaming around in the material. Thermal energy basically produces a pair of Positive-Negative charges.

**INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR**  
> A semiconductor in it's extremely pure form is called instrinsic semiconductor.    
When a semiconductor is connected to the power supply, a electric field is established across the semiconductor. And as we know, there are holes and electrons in a semiconductor at room temperature. In this case holes behave like positive charges and move towards the negative side. Where apparently there are electrons entering through the negative side. So the holes and electrons meet to cancel each other out. At the same time, the loosely held electrons near the positive terminal A are attracted away from their atoms into the positive terminal. This creates new holes near the positive terminal which again drift towards the negative terminal.  
  
**EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTORS**  
> A semiconductor in it's doped form is called extrinsic semiconductor.  
Depending on the type of impurity, these are classified as:  
1. n-type [Arsenic [As], Antimony [Sb]] (5) + Germanium (4)  
2. p-type [Gallium [Ga], Indium [In]] (3) + Germanium (4)  
  
> n-type Semiconductors  
> These are the semiconductors that are doped with a negative type impurity.  
> Majority charge carriers are electrons.  
  
> p-type Semiconductors  
> These are the semiconductors that are doped with a positive type impurity.
> Majority charge carriers are holes.  
  
**FORMATION OF A PN JUNCTION**  
[PN JUNCTION](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/pnjun.html)  
If we bring a p-type and an n-type semiconductor crystal close to one another. There would still be micro gaps between them. So a pn-junction is fabricated using special technique. In this technique, a germanium crystal and an indium crystal are heated upto 500C and they both melt and combine together. They are then solidified under proper conditions and they form one single crystal.  
  
**PROPERTIES OF A PN JUNCTION**  
[PN junction basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRf2VuwBVvs)  
Once the final pn junction is formed the [Depletion Layer](http://www.physics-and-radio-electronics.com/electronic-devices-and-circuits/semiconductor-diodes/depletion-region.html) is formed. The depletion layer acts as a barrier in the movement of electrons and holes. There is now a potential across the depletion layer called the barrier potential.  
For silicon, Vo = 0.7 V  
For germanium, Vo = 0.3 V  
  
For an Electrical Device, in relation to pn junction, there are two biased conditions.  
1. Forward Biased : External DC current cancels the barrier potential.   
2. Reverse Biased : External DC current increases the barrier potential.  
  
### FORWARD BIASED  
P-type is connencted to the positive terminal and the N-type to the negative terminal.  
1. The junction offers very little resistance.  
2. The barrier potential is reduced and is elimintated at one point(depending on the diode).  
3. Current flows because of an established low-resistance path.  
  
### REVERSE BIASED  
N-type is connencted to the positive terminal and the P-type to the negative terminal.  
1. The junction offers very high resistance because the barrier potential actually increases as we increase voltage.  
2. The barrier potential is increased.  
3. No current flows because of a high-resistance path (In theory. There is something called a Reverse Saturation current that still flows through the diode. It is because of the minority charge carriers.).    
  
**BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE**  
It is the minimum voltage at which the pn junction breaks down. And gives rise to a sudden increase in current. At large reverse voltage, these electrons acquire high enough velocities to dislodge valence electrons from semiconductor
atoms. The newly liberated electrons in turn free other valence electrons. In this way, we get an avalanche of free electrons. Therefore, the pn junction conducts a very large reverse current.  
  
**KNEE VOLTAGE**  
It is the forward voltage at which the forward current starts to increase rapidly.  
  
**MAX FORWARD CURRENT**  
The max forward current that a diode can handle.  
  
**PEAK INVERSE VOLTAGE**  
Max reverse voltage that the diode can handle without buring out.
