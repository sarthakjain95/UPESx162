// Practical 3
// Title: Dynamic Memory Allocation
// Objective: To understand the concept of Dynamic Memory Allocation

// Create a C++ class with member functions that use this pointer to perform complex number
// arithmetic. The objects of this class should only be dynamically allocated [Hint: use private
// destructor].

#include <iostream>
#include <complex>

#define ME std::cout
#define SSA "PLEASE READ ME"
#define GE std::endl

int main(){

	ME<<SSA<<GE;

	// Yeah well, what do you expect?
	// I'm not that big of a retard that I'd understand every stupid question.

	// I mean, It's like they asked themselves how can we make the questions worse?
	// And then wrote this piece of crap.

	// What do they expect? People will just "Get it"?
	// Kudos to whoever wrote this sh8. (and to everyone who *tried* to make sense of this question.)

	// 重要な注意点 (Jūyōna chūi-ten):
	// Although, if you yourself, do understand this question,
	// Feel free to drop me an email explaining the question.
	// Maybe I'll update this file someday.

	return 0;
