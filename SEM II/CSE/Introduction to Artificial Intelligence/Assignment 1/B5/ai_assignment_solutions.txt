Ans. 1:
The best way to showcase intelligence of the solution would be to look at the 
results the machine is producing with the given data. While Conventional computing 
only compares the new query within the pre-defined database, An Intelligent machine 
might process and give out the most effective solution. We can use this ability to 
compute large instructions more efficiently, Because the computer is now able to 
make more intelligent decisions(like a Human).

Ans. 3:
To simplify the problem solving, the representation of knowledge is very important in
a information system. Good, Consistent representation of facts, will give out better 
results for the problems.  

When the computer is dealing with Language Processing or NLP, the system has to work
hard comparing large volumes of data to derive conclusions effectively. And good
representation of knowledge(information) can make this task easier.
