Ans 1.

Today's AI systems approach the problems in two different ways:

1. Cognitive Intelligence 
In this approach, the computation focuses largely on understanding and reasoning at a high level. These systems observe and learn and try to simulate the human thought process. The systems that use this approach usually supplement decision making by humans. This approach focuses on the Analytical aspects of Intelligence. 
 
2. Evolutionary Intelligence
In recent years, scientists are trying to make machine learning models better by taking inspiration from the biological evolution by copying some general processes involved in it. Using this approach, scientists are able to make models that are able to better adapt/improve in a changing environment. This new approach enables us to select the best possible solution from the whole generation of solutions. We can test and make these generations and solutions on a computer in a very short amount of time. This approach focuses mainly on the Creative and Practical Aspects of Intelligence.

: Algorithm for TicTacToe :

Step 1:>>  Start
Step 2:>>  Make a 3x3 grid
Step 3:>>  Take User input for a valid position in the grid
Step 4:>>  Update grid
Step 5:>>  Check for 3 consecutive criteria. If found, goto Step 12
Step 6:>>  Check to see if the User is winning by choosing any remaining location. If yes, Choose that location.
Step 7:>>  Check to see if choosing any location results in a win for the computer. If yes, Choose that location.
Step 8:>>  If Step 6 and Step 7 are false, Choose a random location.
Step 9:>>  Update Grid
Step 10:>> If 3 consecutive criteria are found or the grid is full, goto Step 12
Step 11:>> Goto Step 3
Step 12:>> Stop
