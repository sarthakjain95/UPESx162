# NOTE  
  
I never thought I'd make another file (other than the usual python3 class files). But let's face it. There are inconsistencies in these files. Because I've skipped more than just a few classes. 
Here are all of those inconsistencies listed out:  
  
1. CLASSx3.py and CLASSx4.py  

# NOTE 2

I think everyone reading the code in this repo will agree with the fact that the example and the code snippet
the teachers usually use in the class are too basic and weird enough examples. So I thought why not, read the topic
in the class and make your own code snippets for the particular functionality.

So, Starting with this commit, CLASSx5.py, I declare that this repo will not have the exact codes from the class.
Instead, these will follow a general theme of topics taught in the python class.
